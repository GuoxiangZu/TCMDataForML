# TCMDataForML
Provide the traditional Chinese medicine data used for machine learning

Currently the raw information comes from https://lib-nt2.hkbu.edu.hk/database/cmed/cmfid/index.asp

The csv file is generated by the python file.

The information in the column "composition" and "label" in the csv file could be used to train a Text Categorizer Model,
then the model could be used to predict the "label" of any "composition".

To have more idea how to do the training, here is an example https://www.kaggle.com/matleonard/text-classification

TODO

Enrich the python file and the csv file.

Have the torken for the traditional Chinese medicine data text.
