# TCMDataForML

## Basic
Provide the traditional Chinese medicine data used for machine learning

Currently the raw information comes from https://lib-nt2.hkbu.edu.hk/database/cmed/cmfid/index.asp

The csv file IndexName.csv is generated by the the python file writeIndexName.py with the command "python3 writeIndexName.py".
 
The csv file IndexName.csv contains the information of the index for each traditional Chinese medicine, which could be used for the one hot encoding of the traditional Chinese medicine.

Embedding vectors(GloVe vectors) as the embeddings for each traditional Chinese medicine will be build in the next step. More info about GloVe please refer to https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

The csv file TCM.csv is generated by the python file writeDataSet.py with the command "python3 writeDataSet.py".

The information in the column "composition" and "label" in the csv file could be used to train a Text Categorizer Model,
then the model could be used to predict the "label" of any "composition".

To have more idea how to do the training, here is an example https://www.kaggle.com/matleonard/text-classification

## TODO
1. Enrich the python file and the csv file.

2. Have the torken for the traditional Chinese medicine data text.
